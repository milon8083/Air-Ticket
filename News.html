		Biman resumes cargo shipments to the UK

		Biman Bangladesh, the Dhaka based airline, has resumed the transportation of cargo on its scheduled passenger flights to the United Kingdom (UK) as of Wednesday, March 14. The carrier reported that, following inspections earlier this month, it had been awarded the all-critical ACC3 certificate on Monday, March 12, thereby paving the way for the services to resume. The carrier had earlier been granted its RA-3 certificate as a cargo handling agent. As such, the first flight to resume cargo carriage was BG001 Dhaka to Heathrow London Airport on Wednesday.
